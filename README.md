## ðŸ“¥ How to use

- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/fm4teus/nlw-2.git`

To run the application just open the directories and execute the commands below:

- If your database isn't set yet, run `yarn knex:migrate` on the [Server](https://github.com/fm4teus/nlw-2/tree/master/server)
- Run application: `yarn start`

Note that the [Web](https://github.com/fm4teus/nlw-2/tree/master/web) folder contains the responsive application developed for the browser. The 
[Mobile](https://github.com/fm4teus/nlw-2/tree/master/mobile) folder contains the project for mobile devices. The [Server](https://github.com/fm4teus/nlw-2/tree/master/server) folder contains the project backend, which must always be running for both applications to work as expected.
