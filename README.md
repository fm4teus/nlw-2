## 📚 Functionality
- Students can search for teachers filtering by subject, day of the week and/or time.
- Teachers can register their classes providing info about subjects, schedules, prices and contact.

## 🛠 Updates
Next Level Week was an amazing opportunity to improve my knowledge of some powerful technologies. Nevertheless, there is still a lot of room for improvement. In this section, I'll keep you updated as new features are introduced.
- 🔍 Search Filters are now optional. You can display all teachers and search for those that match all parameters or at least some of them.

## 📥 How to use

- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/fm4teus/nlw-2.git`

To run the application just open the directories and execute the commands below:
- Install dependencies: `yarn install`
- If your database isn't set yet, run `yarn knex:migrate` on the [Server](https://github.com/fm4teus/nlw-2/tree/master/server)
- Run application: `yarn start`

Note that the [Web](https://github.com/fm4teus/nlw-2/tree/master/web) folder contains the responsive application developed for the browser. The 
[Mobile](https://github.com/fm4teus/nlw-2/tree/master/mobile) folder contains the application for mobile devices. The [Server](https://github.com/fm4teus/nlw-2/tree/master/server) folder contains the project backend, which must always be running for both applications to work as expected.
